# install_tools

This was a pretty basic script originally, but then I came across John Hammond's repository and discovered his ignition_key script (https://github.com/JohnHammond/ignition_key).  I'm a big fan of John's, and would highly recommend his YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeW9qkBjo3zosnqUbG7CFw for anyone interested in CTF compentitions or Pentesting.  I 'borrowed' some elements for John's script here to make mine a little more flashy.
